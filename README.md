- [ ] `Story 4:    'Customer has added different products in shopping cart. The customer wants the ability to change the quantity of a given cart item and it should reflect the total cart item value and total cart amount.' 											`

 #### Design Points:     
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1	Total cart price should be in header

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2	Product quantity limit - Minimum = 0 and Maximum = 10

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3	When customer clicks on decrement button and quantity is less than equal to zero then it should popup confirmation message : "Remove from &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    cart ?"		

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       3.1	If yes, delete the item			

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      3.2	If no, set quantity to 1
